## Meetings

### Schedule and Cadence

Regular steering committee meetings will be held, at least once per month. 

The entire steering committee is generally expected to attend every meeting, but quorum is met with 3/5 attendance.

## Projects

### Initial Charter

This document will define how the committee is to manage the project until it has transitioned to an elected steering committee, as well as what governance must be in place. 

A charter should cover all of the following topics:
* Scope of rights and responsibilities explicitly held by the steering committee
* Steering committee structure
* Committee decision-making process, including for changes to the charter
* How are meetings conducted
   * Frequency and duration
   * How is meeting information shared
   * Are meetings recorded
   * How is work tracked (eg, steering project board)
   * Member note taker, or a neutral facilitator role that exists outside of the committee
* Election process, including:
   * Who is eligible to run as a candidate
   * How candidates are nominated
   * Special elections in the case someone resigns or is impeached
   * Voter registration and requirements
   * Committee company representation quotas
 
 ### Transition Process
 
 This document will define how the bootstrap steering committe will transition to an elected steering committee.
 
 The transition process must:
 * Organize, execute, and validate an election for replacing bootstrap members 
 * Define the term lengths for elected steering committee members
 * Organize the transition to an elected steering committee so that not all members change out at once
  * Possibly stagger the terms of the bootstrap committee members (ie, the first election would be for 3 committee members, the next election would be held to replace the remaining 2 original bootstrap committee members)
 * Provide documentation to enable the established practices of the committee to continue
